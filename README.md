# Sampling Rate Converter

## What is it?
Sample-rate conversion is the process of changing the sampling rate of a discrete signal to obtain a new discrete representation of the underlying continuous signal.

## Applications
Example: Sample an audio file from 44.1 kHz to 32kHz in order to transmit it through a low-bandwidth communication link.

## Instructions
Using App Designer
- Ensure you have **app designer** installed for MATLAB
- Open MATLAB and double click on **rateConverter.mlapp**

Without App Designer
- Double click on **SamplingRateConverter.mlappinstall**
- Press on **Install** Button
- The application can be accessed from the **APPS** tab of Matlab
