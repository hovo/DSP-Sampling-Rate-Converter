# Sampling Rate Converter

## What is it?
Sample-rate conversion is the process of changing the sampling rate of a discrete signal to obtain a new discrete representation of the underlying continuous signal.

## Applications
Example: Sample an audio file from 44.1 kHz to 32kHz in order to transmit it through a low-bandwidth communication link.
